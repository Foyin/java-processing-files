A few programs to test out programming with a GUI

Processing is a java based language used for making animations, games etc and optimized for visually demanding tasks.
Theres lots of stuff to play with, ideal for artists and game designing to practice with.

"Graphing" takes information from a csv file and represents it in a graph
"personal.pde" is a project i was working on before, it makes creates a spotlight around an object whereever the object goes,
this was the begining of a 2d horror game i was making, but school got too hectic and i had to leave it behind. Will continue
in the future. Candle.pde creates the candle like effect.
